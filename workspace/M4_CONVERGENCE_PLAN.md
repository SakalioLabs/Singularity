# M4 Autonomous Survival Convergence Plan

## Current Gate

- Protocol: `m4-fixed-v1`
- Protocol SHA-256: `a3ff6b9d39fa4955b4c52739f9059ae5969b82c74c4d33d751c79aa7f3b7f202`
- Current target: BM-011 Survive the first night
- Eligible successes: 0/3
- M4 canonical status: `not_run`
- M1, M2, and M3 regression baseline: `repeat_verified`

BM-012, BM-013, and BM-014 remain locked until BM-011 reaches 3/3 eligible live successes.

## Scope

The protocol is independent from M1/M2 task semantics. It reuses the pinned Paper runtime, bridge, machine evidence shape, content hashing, and anti-replay controls. It does not inherit peaceful difficulty, prepared inventory, terminal fixtures, or scripted intermediate goals.

The first BM-011 baseline keeps learned executable skills off. Built-in primitive actions and the LLM planner remain available. `survive_first_night` cannot execute as the root strategy, and quarantined skills are forbidden.

## Gate Ladder

| Gate | Requirement | State |
|---|---|---|
| G0 | Fixed protocol, fresh episode, natural time, one absolute deadline, independent eligibility | passed |
| G1 | Deterministic survival-goal priority cases | passed |
| G2 | One live preparation episode with machine-visible progress | failed_probe_4 |
| G3 | Machine-checkable shelter or approved natural safe-state verification | locked |
| G4 | Hostile, health, hunger, dusk, and night interrupt continuity | locked |
| G5 | First eligible survival-to-dawn episode | locked |
| G6 | Three independent fresh eligible episodes | locked |

G0 passed offline validation. The autonomous loop, planner, verifier, skill/action suppression paths, bridge transport, session evidence, and independent eligibility gate share `episode_deadline_monotonic`. In-flight planner and verifier returns cannot resume execution, deadline-bound bridge actions are single-shot, and missing or unordered monotonic event evidence is ineligible.

G1 passed offline validation. GoalGenerator and Curriculum preserve the fixed order of immediate threat, critical health, hunger/food, shelter preparation, night safety maintenance, and tool/resource progression. Shelter safety requires machine-state verification, and every `auto_goal` event carries source, reason, priority, and priority class.

## Current Hypothesis

The expired-task lifecycle hypothesis is confirmed and closed by the fourth G2 probe. Seven deadline interrupts had seven unique trigger task IDs and seven matching `runtime_interrupt_recovery` events. The recoveries terminalized 28 elapsed tasks, no trigger task repeated, and action execution resumed in cycle 9 after the first recovery. The permanent preemption loop from probe 3 did not recur.

The episode attempted 19 actions, completed 15, recorded two craft attempts, and ended online with `oak_log:4` and `dark_oak_log:4`. None of that resource progress occurred before fixed dusk. The first actionable plan reached `move_to(94,142,-31)` at monotonic 250718.140 while world time was 9494. The action missed tolerance by 0.029 blocks and requested replan. Instead of immediately continuing, the autonomous failure branch called `Reflector.analyze_failure()`. Its only session evidence is a `failure_reflection` memory write at monotonic 250748.125, 29.985 seconds later; the next observation was world time 10094.

The reflection call is outside Planner evidence, has no absolute-deadline timeout, and does not receive the M4 pinned provider controls. It consumed more than the 25.3 seconds that remained before dusk and is the earliest unrecovered transition, earlier than the recovered task interrupts and final episode overrun. The single current hypothesis is that autonomous failure reflection bypasses the M4 LLM deadline/provider-control contract and exhausts the preparation window. The next change is limited to binding or suppressing that reflection path under the shared M4 absolute deadline, with focused offline evidence before one fresh G2 episode in a later round. Craft parameter grounding and shelter construction remain later observations and are not changed in this round.

- BM-011 eligible: false; eligible successes remain 0/3
- Planner controls: passed for 17/17 real schema-valid Planner calls, zero reasoning bytes, maximum latency 10.608 seconds
- Autonomous goals: 4; resource progression switched to emergency shelter priority at night
- Actions: 19 attempted and 15 successful; terminal inventory gained `oak_log:4` and `dark_oak_log:4`, but pre-dusk inventory delta remained empty
- Interrupt retest: 7 unique deadline triggers, 7 recoveries, 28 expired tasks terminalized, no repeated trigger task, and actions resumed after the first recovery
- First unrecovered transition: a failed move at world time 9494 entered an unbounded, unlogged failure-reflection LLM call for 29.985 seconds; the next observation was after dusk at world time 10094
- Deadline: ineligible; Agent ended 0.016 seconds and manifest evidence ended 0.078 seconds after the absolute deadline, with one late Planner call and plan but no post-deadline action

## Evidence Discipline

- One live episode per round.
- One root-cause hypothesis per round.
- At most one principal subsystem change per round.
- Every live result records unique episode, session, and level identities plus result/session hashes.
- Reset, time set, teleport, give, and gamemode operations are allowed only before `autonomous_start` and are forbidden in the active episode.
- Offline fixtures never count as live capability evidence.
- M4 completion requires BM-011 through BM-014 at 3/3 each. Work stops after M4 and does not enter M5.
